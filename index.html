            <p>Tool has been going at it for 30 years now. They have a unique and distictive sound. While the sound has evolved over the years, there's still a very strong thread that weaves all of their musice together. Whether you were a fan from the start in 1990, or a new fan created in 2019 with the release of their newest album, you know they are incredibly awesome musicians that love what they do and they let the music speak for itself.

            It's one of the best accounts of a Tool concert experience that I have read in a long, long time. You should read it if you're a fan and have the time.
